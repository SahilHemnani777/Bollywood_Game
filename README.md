# Bollywood_Game

I've made a two player Bollywood guessing game in which one of the player will be giving the question to another player to guess the Name of the Movie, Hero, Heroine and Song. Only the initials of all will be visible to player who'll be guessing. He'll be having 9 chances as per number of letters in the word "BOLLYWOOD" with each wrong guess one letter or rather one chance will be deducted and if he guessed all the four correctly before the letter of word "BOLLYWOOD" gets over he wins otherwise he looses !
